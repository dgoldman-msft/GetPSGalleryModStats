SHORT DESCRIPTION
	This will take a list of modules and retrieve stats from the PowerShell Gallery

LONG DESCRIPTION
	The purpose of this module will allow you to pass in an array or list of modules that you own on PowerShell Gallery
	and have it report back all of the downloads in a sorted list based on downloads

EXAMPLE 1
    PS c:\> Get-PSGalleryDownloads PSUtil,PSFramework,PSServicePrincipal

EXAMPLE 2
    PS c:\> Get-PSGalleryDownloads PSUtil,PSFramework,PSServicePrincipal -EnableException

NOTES
	Passing objects via splatting or ValueFromPipeline need to be sent in to a Process block otherwise the default behaivor is to start that code path in the End block which will only pull the last item from a collection.

	$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue' is being set to surpress progress bar output which degrades performance
